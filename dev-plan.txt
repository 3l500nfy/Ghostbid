GhostBid Development Phases
===========================

Phase 0 — Foundations
- Align requirements from projectGuid and UI sample.
- Create repo structure (/frontend, /contracts, /fhe, /scripts, /tests).

Phase 1 — Frontend Scaffold
- Bootstrap Vite React + Tailwind.
- Implement routing for Home, CreateAuction, ViewAuction, Finalize.
- Create base components (AuctionCard, BidModal, EncryptedBidViewer, CountdownTimer, WinnerSection, FinalizePanel).

Phase 2 — FHE Client Integration
- Stub Zama client with init + encrypt flows.
- Provide hooks (`useZama`) for UI to consume encryption.
- Validate ciphertext formatting utilities.

Phase 3 — Smart Contracts
- Implement `EncryptedAuction` multi-auction storage with IFHE adapter hooks.
- Implement `AuctionManager` registry referencing `EncryptedAuction`.
- Document comparator strategy in `fhe/comparator.fhe`.

Phase 4 — Hooks & Utils
- Build ethers integration hook (`useAuctionContract`) for submitting bids + finalizing.
- Add helpers for encoding auction params, timers, and ciphertext validation.

Phase 5 — Tooling & Scripts
- Author TypeScript scripts: deploy.ts, simulate_auction.ts, finalize.ts.
- Provide mock FHE helpers for CLI + tests.

Phase 6 — Testing & Verification
- Add Node tests for encryption helper correctness and auction-flow logic (placeholder until Hardhat tests are wired).
- Configure npm scripts for linting + node:test.

Phase 7 — Documentation & Demo Prep
- Write README (overview, architecture, FHE explanation, runbook, roadmap, credits).
- Outline next steps for replacing mocks with real fhEVM artifacts and adding demo video.

Phase 8 — Full FHE Integration (Future Work)
- Swap mocks with actual Zama SDK.
- Implement fhEVM comparator deployment + relayer.
- Expand Jest/Hardhat coverage and e2e flows.
